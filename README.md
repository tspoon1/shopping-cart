Shopping Cart Project for OPIM 243

# Steps to get up and running!
First, create a new repo entitled shopping-cart to get started. After you have done this on the online repo, clone it to your GitHub desktop, open it in your text editior, and create a new file called shopping_cart.py! After this, create a new virtual environment with the conda create -n (env name) python=3.7 command. Launch in to your env to run the script with preloaded info from prof-rossetti!
